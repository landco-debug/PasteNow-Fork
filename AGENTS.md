## Project
PasteNow-Fork — targeted fixes for PasteNow 2.32 (build 761) on macOS Sequoia / Apple Silicon.

## Ground rules
- Base version is fixed at PasteNow 2.32 build 761.
- Do not replace the project with a newer upstream version.
- Work in small, reviewable commits.
- Every project commit must have a matching hand-off subsection in this file describing what changed, why, and what to test.
- Preserve existing PasteNow behavior unless a change is explicitly requested.
- Primary target machine: MacBook Air M1, macOS Sequoia.
- Do not touch unrelated repositories.

## User-reported bug
When multiple image clips are selected in PasteNow and Enter is pressed, only one image is pasted into the active target. Drag-and-drop of the same multi-selection usually transfers all selected images. Desired behavior: Enter should paste the entire current multi-selection, while single-item Enter behavior remains unchanged.

## Commit hand-off log

### Commit 01 — `chore: initialize PasteNow-Fork handoff log`
- Initialized the repository hand-off document.
- Locked the baseline to PasteNow 2.32 build 761.
- Recorded the first target bug and acceptance criteria.
- No application code changed yet.

## Current status
Repository initialized. Next step: obtain the official 2.32 build in CI, inspect the app binary/resources, and locate the keyboard Enter paste path versus the drag-and-drop multi-selection path.
